// levels). `open_carried` hands the PREVIOUS parse's columns back to the reader
// so their `levels` can be MOVED into place instead of rebuilt.

// clonefile/buffered copy of the session's scratch head — and NEITHER can see
// PIET's own session-level format/label overrides, because those live in
// PIET's `varMeta` and never reach the engine. Patching the produced FILE is
// arm-independent by construction: whichever arm made the bytes, the metadata
// lands, and there is exactly one site to keep honest instead of two.
//
// SEMANTICS, in order of how much they matter:
//   1. NO-OP IS BYTE-EXACT. If every requested value already matches what the
//      header says, the file is not written at all and `changed` is false.
//      That is what keeps the freeze corpus from moving on the overwhelmingly
//      common save (no overrides, or overrides equal to what the writer
//      already emitted).
//   2. Payload bytes are NEVER touched. When the new header fits the existing
//      header slot the header is overwritten in place (trailing-space padded,
//      exactly as `write_hbin_full(reserve=true)` already pads — every reader
//      derives data_start from header_len, so this is invisible). Otherwise
//      the file is rebuilt into a sibling temp as {new header, verbatim copy of
//      the whole data region} and rename(2)'d over `path`: the per-column
//      `offset` fields are RELATIVE to data_start, so the data region moves as
//      one opaque block and every column keeps its placement.
//   3. A column named in `patch` that the file does not have is ignored (the
//      caller's live card and the file can legitimately differ); a column the
//      file has and the patch does not name is left alone.
//
// Throws EngineError("data_io", …) on an unreadable/​malformed file or a failed
// write, and leaves `path` untouched in that case (BUG-124/BUG-138 shape: the
// destination is never opened for write on the rebuild path).

// from a hypothetical into an observable one.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE ENUM FROM `CarryOutcome`, and why that is the honest
// shape rather than a convenience: a span-localization miss does **not** cancel

// so the span layer falls back **to the V2 lexing path**, not to
// `Dataset::open`. Folding these values into `CarryOutcome` would break the one

// call that carried as a fallback. The two layers are reported side by side
// (`CARRY_DIAG … outcome=carried span=fallback_span_localize`).
//
