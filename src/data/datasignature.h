// cecon — `datasignature`: a reproducible fingerprint of a Frame's CONTENT.
//
// P1-A3-DATASIG-VERB (plans/P1-A345-RESCOPE-20260730.md §2.4, DESIGN-dta-writer.md
// §4.2 sequencing step 1). This is the head of P1 ARC 3 and the lynchpin of the
// .dta writer's reverse oracle: once a signature exists, "did the writer preserve
// the data?" becomes one string comparison instead of a bespoke diff.
//
// Q9 RULING — engine-deterministic, NOT Stata-exact (decided from live StataBE19.5
// observation by P1-A3-DATASIG-ORACLE, tests/eval/golden/datasig_oracle{,_kfirm}.log;
// full record in tests/eval/manifest.json's P1A3_datasignature_reproducibility
// _comment). Stata's own signature packs an undocumented parenthetical term whose
// behavior is not even self-consistent across fixtures (it moves under a 12-var and
// a 2-var reorder but not under a 3-var one), and there is no published algorithm
// for the two checksums, so there is nothing well-defined to hit bit-for-bit. What
// the oracle DID pin is the CONTRACT Stata's signature satisfies, and that is what
// this function must satisfy too:
//   · deterministic        — same content, same string, every time, in-process or not
//   · reorder-sensitive    — moving a variable changes the string
//   · value-sensitive      — editing one cell changes the string
//   · narrowing-sensitive  — double→float storage narrowing changes the string
//   · format-INsensitive   — a display-format-only edit (%tw→%td) must NOT change it
//                            (Stata's did not; and P1-A0's carried `format` is a
//                            display string that no data-layer decision may read)
//
// SHAPE (Stata-shaped so the object is familiar, never presented as comparable):
//     <rows>:<cols>(<meta>):<vals-a>:<vals-b>
// e.g. `74:12(2148294703):1189232093:3600492578`. `meta` fingerprints the column
// IDENTITY plane (names, order, kind, factor dictionaries); `vals-a`/`vals-b` are two
// differently-seeded fingerprints of the STORED VALUES, mirroring Stata's own pair so
// a single 32-bit collision cannot silently pass a corrupted round-trip.
//
// It is a FREE FUNCTION over `const Frame&`, in its own file, deliberately: a
// signature is a pure function ON a Frame, not Frame state, and frame.{h,cpp} is a
// shared hot file whose manifest surface should not be widened for a read-only
// derivation (P1-A3-DATASIG-VERB row, SPRINT).
