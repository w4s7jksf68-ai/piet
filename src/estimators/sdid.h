//             American Economic Review 111(12), 4088-4118.
//
// Clean-room provenance: implemented from the paper cited above only. No
// existing sdid (Stata or R) package source was read or consulted; conventions
// the paper leaves open are pinned by this project's own committed goldens and
// unit tests, per the clean-room precedent set for csdid
// (docs/legal/CSDID_CLEANROOM_WALL.md).
//
// sdid_run implements AAHIW21's estimator (Algorithm 1): unit weights omega and
// time weights lambda are each chosen by a separate regularized minimum-distance
// problem over the simplex so that the pre-treatment trajectory of the synthetic
// control matches the treated average, and the ATT is the resulting weighted
// diff-in-diff (eq. 2.2-2.3). Staggered adoption is handled as AAHIW21 §A
// prescribes: the panel is split into one block per adoption date (that cohort's
// treated units against the NEVER-treated units, pre = periods before adoption),
// each block is estimated separately, and the block ATTs are averaged with
// weights proportional to each block's count of treated (unit, period) cells,
// N_tr^a * T_post^a. Inference is by vce(): bootstrap (Algorithm 2, resampling
// PANEL UNITS with replacement) is the implemented estimator; reps() and seed()
// parametrize it. The bootstrap draws come from this engine's own counter-based
// RNG (core/rng.h, Philox4x32-10) — fixed-seed bit-reproducibility is ours, and
// is deliberately NOT an attempt to reproduce any other package's draw stream.
//
// Conventions the paper leaves open, pinned here by measurement against the
// project's Stata 19.5 oracle (see tests/unit/test_sdid.cpp for the target and
// sdid.cpp's SWEEP note for the variants tried and rejected):
//   - the noise level sigma feeding zeta is the SAMPLE standard deviation
//     (denominator n-1) of the first differences of the CONTROL units over the
//     block's PRE periods;
//   - zeta_omega = (N_tr * T_post)^(1/4) * sigma, entering the omega program as
//     a ridge zeta_omega^2 * T_pre * ||omega||^2;
//   - the lambda program carries only a numerically negligible ridge
//     (1e-6 * sigma)^2 * N_co;
//   - both programs carry a free intercept (they match trajectory SHAPE, not
//     level), which the solver absorbs by centering;
//   - the block ATTs aggregate with weights proportional to N_tr^a * T_post^a.
//
// AAHIW21's construction requires a COMPLETE panel rectangle (every unit
// observed at every period, with a non-missing outcome) and, for the placebo
// variance estimator, more control than treated units; sdid_run reports these as
// diagnostics instead of silently degrading (see SdidDiagnostic below). The
// incomplete-rectangle guard is LOAD-BEARING, not cosmetic: without it the
// estimator propagates the gaps and returns a missing ATT, which is the exact
// silent-wrong-answer shape this codebase treats as a cardinal defect. That is
// what SdidConfig::unguard_incomplete_panel exists to demonstrate — see its
// comment there.
