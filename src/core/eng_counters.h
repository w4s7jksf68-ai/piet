// ENGINE-SIDE MECHANISM COUNTERS (P2PERF-WAVE-PLAN §W0).
//
// WHY: the Doctrine's gate ② says deterministic counters are the sworn witness
// and timing the noisy one, but three engine mechanisms this campaign optimises
// had NO counter at all, so every claim about them rested on reading the code by
// hand:
//   * write plane   — whether a save took patch_hbin (CoW clone + header rewrite)
//                     or write_hbin_full (a complete re-serialize). This is the
//                     single number the rename work is judged by.
//   * provenance    — how often hash_file_hex actually ran (it is memoised and
//                     deferred; "it is cheap now" was an unmeasured claim).
//   * dataset opens — Dataset already tallies full-parse vs carried opens, but
//                     nothing ever emitted them, so the tallies were unreadable
//                     from outside the process.
//
// CONVENTION — the same one PIET's counters.h follows and for the same reasons:
// process-wide statics, no locking (serve is a synchronous single-threaded
// loop), ALWAYS accumulated, emission opt-in. The accumulate side is one integer
// increment on paths that are already doing file-sized work, so there is no
// "off" build to keep honest; what gates the numbers is the reader — the serve
// `{"frame":{"op":"counters"}}` request, which nothing but an instrumented run
// ever sends. With no reader, stdout is byte-identical to a build without this
// header, which is the freeze-fixture safety property.

// S06/ARC-MRG (P2-PERF WS-D2). `merge` was NAMED, in the P2-PERF close, as opening
// its files three times; nothing measured it. These two make the claim falsifiable:
//
//   g_dataFileOpens  — every PHYSICAL open of a dataset file, wherever it happens:
//                      map_hbin (.hbin mmap), read_dta (.dta), Frame::from_csv
//                      (.csv/.tsv). One increment per open, at the open itself, so
//                      it cannot drift from what the process actually did.
//   g_mergeFileOpens — the delta of the above across ONE cmd_merge invocation. A
//                      scoped delta rather than its own increments, so it counts
//                      opens performed by code cmd_merge never reads (keepif
//                      scratch, the writer's read-back) exactly as it counts its
//                      own. TARGET = 2: the master and the using file, once each.

//                   underneath it". A ladder-GREEN run with dd_accum_used == 0
//                   is a gate that proved nothing — the cache-invalidates-test-
