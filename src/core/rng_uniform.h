// cecon — runiform() / runiformint(), on top of the Philox counter RNG.
//
// AER scope 2, B3(c). Doctrine gate 1 has a named carve-out for this: a
// stochastic estimator satisfies it as 1-S, meaning fixed-seed bit
// reproducibility HERE plus distributional agreement -- never draw-level
// identity with Stata. Stata's stream is Stata's; this one is ours, and the
// corpus lines that use it (`gen tiebreak = ... + runiform(-0.1,0.1)`,
// `gen anchor = runiformint(212,239)`) are tie-breakers and placebo draws whose
// papers depend on the distribution, not on the individual numbers.
//
// This reuses core/rng.h's Philox rather than introducing a second generator:
// its header already states the property this needs -- "a draw is a pure
// function of (seed, counter)" -- and the wild bootstrap already depends on it.
//
// Why a pure function rather than a running generator. This engine has TWO
// evaluators that walk rows in different orders (the scalar ev() and the
// column-at-a-time ev_fn_vec()), plus a bysort path that iterates in sort order.
// A stateful generator would hand back different numbers depending on which one
// ran, silently, because both answers look like noise. Keying every draw on its
// coordinates removes the question: the same cell gets the same number whoever
// asks. The coordinates are
//   seed    `set seed`, carried from the PIET session (this process is a
//           subprocess and remembers nothing between calls)
//   stream  a per-call counter, so two successive `gen`s do not repeat
//   node    which runiform() in the expression, left to right
//   row     the observation
