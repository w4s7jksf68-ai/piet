// CobraSession — persistent `cobra serve` worker client (MAXPERF Stage 1b,
// contract_A §25 stateless serve + §26 resident-frame data plane).
//
// A one-shot `cobra <subcmd> ...` fork/exec per verb (cobra_runner.cpp's
// runCobra) pays a process-spawn tax on EVERY dispatch — and, worse, the
// chain-head model rewrites+mmaps a fresh scratch .hbin per mutation (the
// F5 incident: 2,742 mutations each writing a full dataset). CobraSession
// replaces both: ONE worker child spawned via the same fork/exec+pipes
// discipline as runCobra, then line-delimited JSON requests over its stdin/
// stdout for the worker's whole lifetime. Two request families:
//   • sendStateless(argv)  — §25: byte-equal to a one-shot `cobra argv`
//     (reads --data from disk, writes --out to disk). Kills the spawn tax
//     with zero resident-state coupling — the universal safe path.
//   • frameUse/frameRun/frameSnapshot/frameDrop — §26: the dataset stays
//     RESIDENT in worker RAM across mutations; a mutation advances the
//     resident frame in place (no per-verb file write) and reports a small
//     delta the caller folds into a shadow varlist card. state materializes
//     to disk only on demand (snapshot).
//
// This class owns ONLY the worker process + wire protocol. All resident
// bookkeeping (which path the frame corresponds to, dirty bit, shadow card)
// lives on SessionState, which drives this via the runCobra intercept — see
// cobra_runner.cpp and session_state.{h,cpp}.
