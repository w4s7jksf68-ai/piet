// PIET 2.2.0 item D — persisted app-shell settings + hardware detection.
//
// The "Engine & scratch" half of the Settings panel is persisted NATIVELY
// here (a small JSON file in the per-user config dir); the "Display" half
// (editor/results font size, paste-autorun mirror) is frontend localStorage
// and never reaches this module. Classified app-shell (same family as
// dialog.open / legal.notices): NOT a Boundary-B kernel endpoint, no
// SessionState, no ResultBlock — contract_B is unchanged. The settings.get /
// settings.set routes (routes.h) are thin JSON wrappers over the free
// functions below, kept as free functions so selftest.cpp can exercise them
// without opening a real window.
