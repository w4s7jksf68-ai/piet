// P9 automode · L2 — the effect table and the approval predicate's evidence base.
//
// THE SAFETY AXIOM (design brief §10.2, User-ratified): the recognizer says
// "parallelizable" ONLY when a whitelist holds for every statement in the
// region. One unknown command, one unresolvable path, one summary it cannot
// compute — and the region runs serially. A false negative costs speed; a false
// positive is forbidden, because it silently produces wrong output.
//
// That axiom is why this is a SPARSE table and not a field on CommandSpec.
// registry.h's append-only default-valued fields (byIllegalInStata,
// communityNames) are exactly the right pattern for a property whose default is
// harmless. Here the default must be "I do not know", and a default-valued
// column on all 162 registry rows would read as "known, effect-free" for every
// row nobody has classified yet — the forbidden direction. Absence from THIS
// table is UNKNOWN, and unknown refuses.
