// P9 automode · call-site path substitution — the last thing standing between
// the recognizer and a real corpus.
//
// THE PROBLEM. Rule 10 of the region predicate refuses any task that writes a
// file whose path it cannot resolve, because two tasks writing the same path is
// a silent corruption and "probably different" is not a proof. On the acceptance
// corpus every task ends in
//
//     graph export "`pm_output_dir'/plot_`pm_season_scope'_`pm_analysis_mode'_`pm_group_name'.png"
//
// three program levels below the statement being judged. Nothing about that is
// unknowable — it is just several hops away.
//
// WHAT IS ACTUALLY NEEDED, measured rather than assumed (analysis.do, 2026-08-14):
//   * `plot_multi_group` and `plot_multi_depvars` take their parameters
//     POSITIONALLY, and NOT through `args`: each opens with
//     `local rest `"`0'"'` followed by a run of `gettoken NAME rest : rest`,
//     which is positional extraction spelled long-hand. A design that only
//     understood `args` would have resolved nothing here.
//   * The outer program forwards those six values, in order, to the inner one.
//   * The path is built from positions 3, 5, 4 and 6.
//   * At the 47 call sites, positions 3/4/5 are the SAME caller locals every
//     time and position 6 is a literal tag that is distinct in all 47.
//
// THE RULE, and why it is still one-sided. A path becomes a TEMPLATE: an
// ordered list of literal chunks and symbols, where a symbol is either a
// parameter hole (bound to a position, so a call site fills it) or an opaque
// local (a name this layer cannot evaluate). Two tasks' templates are
// COMPARABLE only when their opaque-symbol sequences are identical — same name
// in the same place means the same run-time value, whatever it is. When they are
// comparable, they are disjoint iff their literal skeletons differ. Anything
// else — an unparsable path, a symbol that resolves to nothing, a differing
// opaque sequence — is UNRESOLVED and refuses, exactly as before.
