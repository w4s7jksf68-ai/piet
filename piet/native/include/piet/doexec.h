// do-executor — C++ port of piet/backend/piet/doexec.py: preprocess + brace-
// aggregate + replay .do source through the dispatcher, one top-level item
// (command line or aggregated loop/if block) at a time.
//
// Thread-lifetime discipline (ROADMAP "M0 shell-review carry-forward",
// binding at M3): executeDoSource does real background work when invoked
// as a run's progress owner (B1 liveness). It NEVER touches piet::Shell or
// spawns its own std::thread — callers that want live UI progress push
// (M4) are responsible for running executeDoSource on a worker thread they
// own and joining it before any Shell teardown; this module only publishes
// to SessionState's mutex-guarded RunProgress snapshot (safe to read from
// any thread) and never holds a dangling Shell&/window reference itself.

//
// Exported 2026-08-14 (P9 entry wave) for `loops::runParallelBlock`. A brace
// block is normally one top-level item, so a loop's whole body shares one card
// — but the parallel block's contract is that its tasks produce the output they
// would have produced as ordinary top-level statements (design brief §2.5,
// byte-identical to serial). It therefore has to apply this per TASK, and the
// probe's A0 arm is what proved it: without the per-task call, task 1-3's cards
// were thinned away and only task 4 kept one, so the wrapper changed output at
// every worker count while cmp(A1,AN) stayed perfectly blind to it.
