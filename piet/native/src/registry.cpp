// THE TABLE. Hand-transcribed from dispatcher.cpp:809-2203 (main@b830908 ==
// op/piet@b830908 at scouting time — see A0-anchor-map.md). Row order
// mirrors arm order in dispatcher.cpp so this can be diffed against the
// source by eye. Where one if-arm structurally serves several DISTINCT
// Stata command names (not spelling-variants of the same word), each name
// gets its own row, same handlerTag, noted inline — full list also called
// out in the A0 task's return summary for operator review.
//
// Field derivation rules applied uniformly (see registry.h's CommandSpec
// doc for the exact rule text):
//   allowInRange = ORIGINALLY (A0) true iff the name was in tokenizer.cpp's
//                  hardcoded list {list, browse, br, gen, generate, g,
//                  replace} — that hardcode is long gone (A3/BS-096 made
//                  this table the tokenizer's live source of truth). BS-090
//                  (BETA campaign, Phase G) then flipped allowInRange=true
//                  for every command whose row-filtering machinery can
//                  actually apply an `in a/b` restriction: summarize/sum,

//                  feols/reghdfe, tabulate/tab/tab1/tab2, duplicates
//                  (report/tag/list real; drop honest-rejects `in`, same
//                  disclosed boundary as its existing `if` reject), egen,

//                  context, then fold `in a/b` into an ordinary numeric
//                  `--keepif` predicate on that column). Every OTHER row
//                  stays false: still-legal-but-unimplemented Stata forms

//                  forward the whole `parsed` struct to a handlers::runXxx
//                  overload that takes ParsedCommand — those are marked
//                  true as "forwarded", not independently re-verified

// BUG-105 (ONESHOT-PREP9 WS-K, 2026-08-07) — the `abbrev` lists below were
// corrected against a LIVE StataBE oracle, not against a rule. The measured
// table is plans/BUG105-ABBREV-SOURCING-20260731.md §3 (30 commands × every
// prefix = 190 `capture noisily` attempts, plus 32 `which` identity calls to
// separate "some command ran" from "THAT command ran"); the oracle scripts are
// kept at private-notes/plans/instruments/bug105-abbrev-oracle/.
//
// Three standing rules this table now encodes, all measurement-derived:
//   1. NO computed prefix rule. Stata's accepted set is non-contiguous
//      (`hist`✓ `histo`✗ `histogram`✓ · `tab`✓ `tabl`✗ `table`✓ · `d`=describe
//      but `dr`=nothing), so any prefix rule would ACCEPT SPELLINGS REAL STATA
//      REJECTS — fabricated parity, the exact defect BUG-105 exists to close.
//   2. Inventing an abbreviation is the same defect class as omitting one.
//      histogram/drop/keep/poisson/codebook/tabstat/ttest/table/preserve/
//      scatter were measured as full-spelling-only and are left EXACTLY so.
//   3. The 89 registry rows the oracle never probed stay exact-match-only
//      (today's behaviour, blast radius 0) until probed by the same two-pass
//      method. `probe.do` is the generator, not a fixed list.
//
// Every widened row below is reachable because dispatcher.cpp normalises the
// routed token through registry::resolveCanonical() exactly once — the arms,
// kNoDataCommands and kFixedArityCommands all see the canonical spelling, so a
// spelling can no longer be routable in the tokenizer's gates and unknown in
// the dispatcher (the asymmetry that made the 07-31 stopgap a two-file edit).
const std::vector<CommandSpec>& commandRegistry() {
