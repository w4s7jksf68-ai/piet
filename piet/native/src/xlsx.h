// Minimal .xlsx (SpreadsheetML) reader/writer — P1 wave `import excel` /
// `export excel`.
//
// Scope, stated plainly: this is a DATA interchange layer, not an Excel
// implementation. It reads the cell values of the first worksheet (or a named
// one) and writes a single worksheet of values. No styles, formulas, dates as
// formatted values, merged cells, or multiple sheets on write.
//
// Two facts drove the shape:
//   * a .xlsx is a ZIP of XML parts, and every real producer (Excel, Stata)
//     DEFLATEs those parts — so the reader must inflate. RFC 1951 is
//     implemented here from the specification (fixed + dynamic Huffman and
//     stored blocks); there is no third-party dependency in this repo to lean
//     on and adding one for four call sites is not worth the supply chain.
//   * the writer does NOT need to compress: STORE (method 0) is a fully legal
//     ZIP method that Excel, Numbers, LibreOffice and Stata all open. Writing
//     stored entries keeps the writer to a CRC-32 and a header layout.
