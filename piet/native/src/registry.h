// Phase A0 (BETA campaign) — the command registry: a single hand-transcribed
// table describing TODAY's dispatcher.cpp routing behavior, one row per
// canonical Stata command PIET actually routes. NOT a self-registration
// mechanism (dispatcher.cpp's ~75 `if (cmd == "...")` arms are anonymous
// if-bodies, nothing to attach a REGISTER macro to) and NOT a refactor of
// the dispatcher — see dispatcher.cpp:809-813's own "TODO(M3) EXTENSION
// POINT" comment. This table is a read-only DESCRIPTION of that if-chain,
// built by hand against dispatcher.cpp:809-2203 (the routing table),
// eval/tokenizer.cpp:507-519/529-539 (the weight/`in` allow-lists), and
// dispatcher.cpp:596-678 (the by/bysort gate) — see
// milf-coord/plans/BETA-20260712-campaign/A0-anchor-map.md for the full
// scouting trail this transcription is built from.
//
// Consumers:
//   - `piet_native --dump-registry` (this file's runDumpRegistry(), wired in
//     main.cpp's flag loop) dumps every row as JSON to stdout.
//   - tools/freeze_matrix.py reads that JSON to enumerate one frozen
//     invocation per registered command against tests/kitchensink/debug_all.do.
//   - selftest.cpp's testRegistryRoutes() is the drift guard: for every
//     canonical/abbrev spelling here, dispatch a minimal probe and assert
//     dispatcher.cpp never silently answers with the generic
//     unsupported_command("piet_gap") fallthrough (dispatcher.cpp:2201-2203)
//     — i.e. this table and the real if-chain must never drift apart.
//   - A3 (BETA campaign, BS-096): this table is no longer JUST a read-only
//     description — eval/tokenizer.cpp's weight/`in` qualifier gates and
//     dispatcher.cpp's by:/bysort: reject-message branch now CONSULT
//     findByName() at runtime instead of maintaining their own second copy
//     of the allow-lists this table was originally transcribed from. The
//     drift guard above still matters (arguably more): a row drifting from
//     the real dispatcher behavior now changes enforcement, not just
//     documentation.
//
// Deliberately NOT here (out of scope for A0 — see the anchor map + the
// task brief that spawned this file):
//   - `bysort`/`by` themselves are NOT rows: they are a PREFIX mechanism
//     (dispatcher.cpp:596-678), not a standalone command with one behavior.
//     Their gating is instead exposed per-row via allowByPrefix (true for
//     generate/gen/g, replace, egen, and — BS-092, BETA Phase G — summarize;
//     the only sub-commands the by-gate structurally supports; every other
//     sub-command is explicitly rejected, never silently flattened).
//   - Fixed-arity / trailing-token validation (dispatcher.cpp's
//     kFixedArityCommands, ~787-806) has no field here — it is a real
//     dispatcher behavior this table does not attempt to model.

// dispatcher.cpp's by/bysort prefix words, which are deliberately NOT rows).
//
// Why this exists: the tokenizer's qualifier gates already resolved through
// findByName() while dispatcher.cpp's ~75 `cmd == "..."` arms compared
// hardcoded literals, so a spelling could be routable in one and unknown in
// the other — which is what forced the 2026-07-31 BUG-105 stopgap to edit BOTH
// files for each of its five spellings. Normalising ONCE at dispatcher.cpp's
// single `cmd` formation site (and its by/bysort sibling) makes every future
// abbreviation a one-line registry edit, and makes the out-of-registry
// spelling copies (kNoDataCommands, kFixedArityCommands, the by-prefix
// sub-command literals) see the canonical name automatically.
//
// The POLICY is unchanged and deliberately NOT a computed prefix rule: real
// Stata's accepted-spelling union is non-contiguous (`hist` runs, `histo` does

// declared spellings resolve.
//
// ONE deliberate exemption: a spelling this row lists in `communityNames` is
// returned UNCHANGED. A community-package compatibility name is not an
// abbreviation of our canonical command — `reghdfe` sits in the `feols` row's
// abbrev list for routing, but it is behaviourally distinct downstream
// (handlers.cpp's runRegress reads `stataCmd == "reghdfe"` for the
// keepsingletons net and the estimator label), and dispatcher.cpp's extcompat
// gate must still see the typed community name. Folding it to `feols` here
// would silently kill both. `reghdfe` is the only spelling this exemption
// currently reaches (every other community name is its own canonical).
